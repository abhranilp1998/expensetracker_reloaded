### Test 2: Check Permissions UI ✅

1. Open Ledgerly app
2. Go to **Settings → Permissions**

| Permission | Status | Icon |
|-----------|--------|------|
| SMS Messages | Try to grant | 💬 |
| Contacts | Try to grant | 👥 |

**Expected Result**:

2. **Send yourself an SMS**:
   ```

   ```
3. **Watch the app** - transaction should appear immediately
4. **Check debug logs** in terminal:
   ```bash
   flutter logs
   ```
   Look for:
   ```

   ```

### Test 4: Send Test SMS (App Background) ✅

1. **Minimize or close the app** (but keep it in recent apps)
2. **Send yourself an SMS**:
   ```
   Bank: Your card ending in 5678 was debited ₹1200
   ```
3. **Wait 2-3 seconds**
4. **Check notification bar** - should see:
   ```
   New Expense Detected (Background)
   ₹1200.00 spent
   Daily total: ₹[X]
   ```
5. **Tap notification** to open app
6. **Verify** the transaction appears in the list

## Troubleshooting Matrix

### Problem: Permissions Show "Blocked"
**Cause**: Permission was denied permanently  
**Solution**: 
1. Go to **Settings → Apps → Ledgerly → Permissions**
2. Manually enable SMS permission
3. Restart app
4. Go to **Settings → Permissions** in app
5. Should show "Granted" now

### Problem: SMS Arrives But Not Detected
**Cause**: Regex pattern doesn't match your bank's format  
**Solution**:
1. Copy the exact SMS text
2. Check against patterns in Test 5
3. If not matching, report the SMS format
4. Regex can be updated to support more formats

### Problem: Notification Doesn't Show
**Cause**: Notifications disabled for app  
**Solution**:
1. Go to **Settings → Apps → Ledgerly → Notifications**
2. Enable notifications
3. Send test SMS
4. Notification should appear

### Problem: Daily Total Not Updating
**Cause**: Transaction parsed but not saved  
**Solution**:
1. Check logcat for: `💰 Expense detected`
2. If message shows, expense was parsed
3. If total doesn't update, SharedPreferences issue
4. Try: close app completely → reopen → test again

### Problem: Only Works When App Is Open
**Cause**: Background handler not receiving broadcasts  
**Solution**:
1. Check `backgroundMessageHandler()` in logs
2. Should show: `🔔 Background SMS Handler triggered`
3. If missing, Android might not be routing SMS to receiver
4. Try: `flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter run --release`
